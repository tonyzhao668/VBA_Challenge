# VBA_Challenge
# The VBA of Wall Street

## Background

Use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

### Files

* [Test Data](Resources/alphabetical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing scripts.

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run scripts on this data to generate the final report.


## Jobs have been done

### 1.

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* Conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.


### 2.

1. To return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". 

2. Allow the VBA script to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.

### 3.

* Use the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing the code. This data set is smaller and will allow to test faster. 

* Make sure that the script acts the same on the final `Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx` sheet.
